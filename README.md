# Mirror-Displays

This is a fork of MirrorDisplays by Dominic Clifton, the original was created by Fabián Cañas, details of it can be found here:

http://www.fabiancanas.com/Projects/MirrorDisplays/

Original source here:

https://code.google.com/p/mirror-displays

I forked it via github since I could not find a git repo to fork so the SVN trunk was imported.

The updated code can be found here:

https://github.com/hydra/mirror-displays

I will gladly accept pull-requests and grant people contributor access to the github repository.

## Current Status

The command line tool, mirror, has been updated to support up to 10 displays.  It has currently only been tested with 3, and only on my hackintosh - it might not even work with just two like the original, more testing and feedback is required.

Please use github to raise issues, here's a link:
